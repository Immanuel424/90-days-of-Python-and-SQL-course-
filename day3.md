# INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR INTRODUCTION CLASS

# Tell me about Python?
**Python** is a general Purpose, **Dynamic**, Highlevel, **Interpreted** programming language, it was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990 
- General Purpose- is a programming language that can create all types of programs.
- Dynamic - Python is dynamically typed, which means we don't need to declare the type of a variable. we can assign values of any type to   a variable, and the type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value. For example, we can assign an integer to a variable and   later assign a string to the same variable without any explicit type declarations.

# Why Python is so popular now a days?
- Becuase it is easy to learn and Use and its is code readability, easy to understand the syntax
- Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines or in simple syntax, compare to C++ or JAVA
- Because of its Versatile Nature -Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications. It has extensive       libraries and frameworks that support web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.
- It Exist Inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequntly uned concepts.

# Features of Python
**Interprted** - 
- There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++, Java
- Directly run the program from the source code.
- Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called **bytecodes** then which reads and executes the code line   by line by translating and run it.
**Platform Independenet**
- Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
- Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macbook, Solaris and many more.
**Free and Open Source** - Redistributable
**High Level Language
- High-level languages are designed to be human-readable and programmer-friendly.
**Simple** 
- Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn
- More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
**Embeddable**
- Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the programâ€™s users.
**Robust** 
- Exceptional handling features
- Memory management techniques in built
**Easy-to-learn**
- Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
**Easy-to-read**
- Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
**Easy-to-maintain**
- source code is fairly easy-to-maintained
**Databases**
- Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Python

               Advanatges                                                       Disadvanatages
 - Python Supports all Functions and Performs Easily      - it has limited support for mobile app development and browser-based apps
 - Python Code run Line by Line                           - Runs the Program Slowly as compares to other languages
 - Pyhton Syntax is Very Simple                           - Memory Consumption Compared to other languages 
 - Pyhton GUI Provide better Functionality as 
   compared to other langauges 
 - Phython is Easy to Maintain

 # Interpreted vs Compiled time programming languages. Explain in detail?
``` 
**Interpreted Programming Language**
   Interpreted languages, as the name suggests, are executed by an interpreter. When an interpreted language program is run, the            interpreter reads the source code line by line, translates each line into bytecode, and executes it immediately.
   **Some examples of interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP**
   Key Characteristics of Interpreted Language is 
   1 Readability and Portability
   2 Dynamic Typing
   3 Immediate Feedback and Debugging
   4 Slower Execution Speed
   
**Compiled Programming Language**
   Compiled languages, on the other hand, go through a separate compilation step before execution. The source code is first passed          through a compiler, which translates the entire code into machine code or bytecode in a single process. This compiled code is then        executed directly by the computer's hardware or a virtual machine
   **Examples of compiled languages include C, C++, Java, and Go**
   Key Characteristics of Compiled Language is 
   1 Performance
   2 Static Typing
