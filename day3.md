# INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR INTRODUCTION CLASS

# Tell me about Python?
**Python** is a general Purpose, **Dynamic**, Highlevel, **Interpreted** programming language, it was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990 
- General Purpose- is a programming language that can create all types of programs.
- Dynamic - Python is dynamically typed, which means we don't need to declare the type of a variable. we can assign values of any type to   a variable, and the type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value. For example, we can assign an integer to a variable and   later assign a string to the same variable without any explicit type declarations.

# Why Python is so popular now a days?
- Becuase it is easy to learn and Use and its is code readability, easy to understand the syntax
- Programmers can express logical concepts in fewer lines or in simple syntax, compare to C++ or JAVA
- Because of its Versatile Nature -Python is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications. It has extensive       libraries and frameworks that support web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and more.
- It Exist Inbuilt functions for almost all of the frequntly uned concepts.

# Features of Python
  **Interprted** - 
- There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C and C++, Java
- Directly run the program from the source code.
- Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called **bytecodes** then which reads and executes the code line   by line by translating and run it.

  **Platform Independenet**
- Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
- Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macbook, Solaris and many more.

  **Free and Open Source** - Redistributable
  
  **High Level Language
  - High-level languages are designed to be human-readable and programmer-friendly.
 
  **Simple** 
  - Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn
  - More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
  
  **Embeddable**
  - Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the programâ€™s users.
 
  **Robust** 
  - Exceptional handling features
  - Memory management techniques in built

  **Easy-to-learn **
  - Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
  
  **Easy-to-read **
  - Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
  
  **Easy-to-maintain *
  - source code is fairly easy-to-maintained
  
  **Databases**
  - Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
