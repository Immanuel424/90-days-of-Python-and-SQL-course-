# What is Variable ?
Variables are the **containers** to store **data/Values** or it can also be called as **"Identifiers"**
```
x = 20
```
Here **X** is Variable, which is holding the value 20
- Value -- Fixed ,           Variable - Changes 

# How Variable will going to create in python to hold the Values or data?
It will be done by 2 methods,
1 Write Operation
2 Read Operation 
# 1 Write Operation
- whenever we assign any value/data to the variable **First it starts execute from RHS**
- next, it will check whether the variable contains **Value/Expression**
- if the **Variable** contains **Value**   ----> Python going to find its type of **value** then that **value** will be converted to                                                      **Binary format**
- if the **Variable** contains **Expression**--> Python **First simplifies the Expression** and gets the **final value** for that and                                                      that **value** will be converted to **Binary format** 
- for that Binary format -- **(memory allocation adress)** will be given and the same **memory address** will be given to the *variable* 
# 2 Read Operation 
Read operation is nothing but **once the memory allocation adress is given to the variable, Python will got the adress of the variable and it will take the binary value from that adress and convert it to decimal format and retrieve the result**.
```
Example --- x = 20 
            print(x) ---->> read Operation 
```
