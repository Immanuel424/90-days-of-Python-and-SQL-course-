## Operators
**General Meaning**
  An Operator is defined as a charecter used in mathematics or in programming to execute specific task
- Let's consider **"X"** is an operator in mathematics that executes the condition called **"Multiplication"**

**Python Operator**
  An Operators are Special kind of symbols which is used to perform **Arthematic or Logical Computition**. an Operator alone cannot perform an activity, it needs an **Operand**.
  an Operand is a value that the operator need to complete a task.
  
  # Types of Operator
  - Arthmetic Operators
  - Comparision Operators
  - Assignment Operators
  - Logical Operators
  - Bitwise Operators
  - Membership Operators
  - Special Operators
      1. Identity Operators
      2. Membership Operators

# Arthimetic Operators

  Arthimetic Operators are used to executing the mathematical functions in python which includes Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, etc
  
  ```
         Operators                      Description                                Examples
         + Plus                  Add two numbers                                   3+3 = 6
         - Minus                 Right hand Operand subtracted                    20-10 = 10
                                 from the left hand operand.
         * Multiplication        It Multiplies the values on either               10*10 = 100
                                 side of the operands.
         / Division              left hand operand divided by                      5/2 = 2.5
                                 right hand operand.
         % Percent               It divides the left hand operand                   6%2 = 3
                                 by right hand one and also returns reminder.
         // Floor division       Division that results into whole number           >>> 5/2= 2.5  
                                 adjusted to the left in the number line.          >>> 5/2= 2
         **Exponent              Left operand is raised to the power of right     10 to the power of 30
  ```
  
  **Python (+)Addition Operator**
  
  - Addition Operator in python is being used to add two operand values in python programming language.
    
  **Program**
    
    x = 10
    y = 10
    output = x + y
    print ("x + y:", output)
    Result ===> x + y : 20
   
    
  **Python (-)Subtract Operator**
  
  - Subtract Operator in python being used to subtract the values it usually Subtract the right hand operand from left hand operand.

   **Program**
   
   ```
   x = 20
   y = 10
   output = x - y
   print ("x - y:", output)
   Result ===> x - y : 10
   
   ```
   
 **Python()Multiplication Operator**
 
 - Multiplication operator in python being used to Multiply the values given.
 
 **Program**
 
 ```
 x = 10
 y = 5
 output : x * y
 print ("x * y:", output)
 Result ===> x * y : 50
 
 ```
  
**Python(/)Division Operator**

- Division operator in python being used to divide the given values.

**Program**
```
x = 10
y = 5
output : x/5
print ("x/y:", output)
Result ===> x / y = 2
```

**Python(%)percentile Operator**

- Percentile operator in python being used to get the remainder value once the values get divide.

**Program**
```
x = 10
y = 3
output : x % y
print ("x % y:", output)
Result ===> x % y = 1
```

**Python(//)Floor Division Operator**

- Floor Division operator in python is once the value get divided then the remainder if any decimal value then it adjusted to give only integer value.

**Program**
```
x = 5
y = 2
output: x // y 
print ("x // y:", output)
Result ===> x // y = 2
```

**Python()Exponent Operator**

- Exponent operator is used in Python to perform exponential (power) calculations by using operators.

**Program**
```
x = 10
y = 4
output : x ** y
print ("x ** y:", output)
Result ===> x ** y = 10000
```

# Python Comparision Operators

- The name itself is explaining that this operator is used to compare different things or values with one another. Comparison operator is also termed as a relational operator because it   explains the connection between them.

 > The Different Comparision operators are as follows
  - == Equal
  - !=  Not Equal
  - <>  Two Operands are not equal
  - (>) Greater Than
  - <   Less Than
  - (>=)Greater Than or Equal to
  - <=  Less Than or Equal to
