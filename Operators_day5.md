## Operators
**General Meaning**
  An Operator is defined as a charecter used in mathematics or in programming to execute specific task
- Let's consider **"X"** is an operator in mathematics that executes the condition called **"Multiplication"**

**Python Operator**
  An Operators are Special kind of symbols which is used to perform **Arthematic or Logical Computition**. an Operator alone cannot perform an activity, it needs an **Operand**.
  an Operand is a value that the operator need to complete a task.
  
  # Types of Operator
  - Arthmetic Operators
  - Comparision Operators
  - Assignment Operators
  - Logical Operators
  - Bitwise Operators
  - Membership Operators
  - Special Operators
      1. Identity Operators
      2. Membership Operators

# Arthimetic Operators

  Arthimetic Operators are used to executing the mathematical functions in python which includes Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, etc
  
  ```
         Operators                      Description                                Examples
         + Plus                  Add two numbers                                   3+3 = 6
         - Minus                 Right hand Operand subtracted                    20-10 = 10
                                 from the left hand operand.
         * Multiplication        It Multiplies the values on either               10*10 = 100
                                 side of the operands.
         / Division              left hand operand divided by                      5/2 = 2.5
                                 right hand operand.
         % Percent               It divides the left hand operand                   6%2 = 3
                                 by right hand one and also returns reminder.
         // Floor division       Division that results into whole number           >>> 5/2= 2.5  
                                 adjusted to the left in the number line.          >>> 5/2= 2
         **Exponent              Left operand is raised to the power of right     10 to the power of 30
  ```
  
  **Python (+)Addition Operator**
  
  - Addition Operator in python is being used to add two operand values in python programming language.
    
    **Program**
    
    ```
    x = 10
    y = 10
    output = x + y
    print ("x + y:", output)
    Result ===> x + y : 20
    
    ```
    
  **Python (-) Subtract Operator**
  
  -
